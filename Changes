Revision history for LogFilter

0.03 2023-06-14
    - Moved test files (test_keywords.txt, test_exclude.txt, test_log.txt) to the 't' directory.
    - This change ensures that the test script can correctly locate these files during test execution.

0.02 2023-06-14
    - Modified test file (01_basic.t) to handle real-time log monitoring.
      Now, the test script starts a child process to update the test log periodically. 
      The filter method in the test is given a timeout, and it terminates after a set period of time.
    - This change allows us to perform real-time log analysis while ensuring that the tests don't run indefinitely.

0.01 2023-06-12
    - Initial release. 
    - Basic log filtering capabilities using a keywords file, an exclude file, and a log file.
