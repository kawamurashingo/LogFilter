    - Fixed a bug in test script where log file was being created in unexpected location due to use of relative path.
    - Switched to using absolute path for creating and updating log file in the test script.

0.05 2023-06-14
    - Fixed issue with locating test data files in test script

0.03 2023-06-14
    - Moved test files (test_keywords.txt, test_exclude.txt, test_log.txt) to the 't' directory.
    - This change ensures that the test script can correctly locate these files during test execution.

0.02 2023-06-14
    - Modified test file (01_basic.t) to handle real-time log monitoring.
      Now, the test script starts a child process to update the test log periodically. 
      The filter method in the test is given a timeout, and it terminates after a set period of time.
    - This change allows us to perform real-time log analysis while ensuring that the tests don't run indefinitely.
